    "The good news is that they've discovered project management! This has given them the tools they need to prevent their usual Christmas emergency. For example, they now know that the North Pole decorations need to be finished soon so that other critical tasks can start on time. The bad news is that they've realized they have a different emergency: according to their resource planning, none of them have any time left to decorate the North Pole! To save Christmas, the Elves need you to finish decorating the North Pole by December 12th.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "You arrive at the secret entrance to the North Pole base ready to start decorating. Unfortunately, the password seems to have been changed, so you can't get in. A document taped to the wall helpfully explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Due to new security protocols, the password is locked in the safe below. Please see the attached document for the new combination.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The safe has a dial with only an arrow on it; around the dial are the numbers 0 through 99 in order. As you turn the dial, it makes a small click noise as it reaches each number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attached document (your puzzle input) contains a sequence of rotations, one per line, which tell you how to open the safe. A rotation starts with an L or R which indicates whether the rotation should be to the left (toward lower numbers) or to the right (toward higher numbers). Then, the rotation has a distance value which indicates how many clicks the dial should be rotated in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the dial were pointing at 11, a rotation of R8 would cause the dial to point at 19. After that, a rotation of L19 would cause it to point at 0. Because the dial is a circle, turning the dial left from 0 one click makes it point at 99. Similarly, turning the dial right from 99 one click makes it point at 0. So, if the dial were pointing at 5, a rotation of L10 would cause it to point at 95. After that, a rotation of R5 could cause it to point at 0.\n",

    "The dial starts by pointing at 50.\n",

    "You could follow the instructions, but your recent required official North Pole secret entrance security training seminar taught you that the safe is actually a decoy. The actual password is the number of times the dial is left pointing at 0 after any rotation in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the attached document contained the following rotations:\n",

    "```\n",
    "The dial starts by pointing at 50.\n",
    "The dial is rotated L68 to point at 82.\n",

    "The dial is rotated R14 to point at 14.\n",
    "The dial is rotated L82 to point at 32.\n",

They even have a list of where the red tiles are located in the grid (your puzzle input).\n",

    "Just across the hall, you find a large factory. Fortunately, the Elves here have plenty of time to decorate. Unfortunately, it's because the factory machines are all offline, and none of the Elves can figure out the initialization procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves do have the manual for the machines, but the section detailing the initialization procedure was eaten by a Shiba Inu. All that remains of the manual are some indicator light diagrams, button wiring schematics, and joltage requirements for each machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}\n",
    "[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}\n",
    "[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The manual describes one machine per line. Each line contains a single indicator light diagram in [square brackets], one or more button wiring schematics in (parentheses), and joltage requirements in {curly braces}.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a machine, its indicator lights must match those shown in the diagram, where . means off and # means on. The machine has the number of indicator lights shown, but its indicator lights are all initially off.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, an indicator light diagram like [.##.] means that the machine has four indicator lights which are initially off and that the goal is to simultaneously configure the first light to be off, the second light to be on, the third to be on, and the fourth to be off.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can toggle the state of indicator lights by pushing any of the listed buttons. Each button lists which indicator lights it toggles, where 0 means the first light, 1 means the second light, and so on. When you push a button, each listed indicator light either turns on (if it was off) or turns off (if it was on). You have to push each button an integer number of times; there's no such thing as \"0.5 presses\" (nor can you push a button a negative number of times).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a button wiring schematic like (0,3,4) means that each time you push that button, the first, fourth, and fifth indicator lights would all toggle between on and off. If the indicator lights were [#.....], pushing the button would change them to be [...##.] instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because none of the machines are running, the joltage requirements are irrelevant and can be safely ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can push each button as many times as you like. However, to save on time, you will need to determine the fewest total presses required to correctly configure all indicator lights for all machines in your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to correctly configure the first machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You could press the first three buttons once each, a total of 3 button presses.\n",
    "- You could press (1,3) once, (2,3) once, and (0,1) twice, a total of 4 button presses.\n",
    "- You could press all of the buttons except (1,3) once each, a total of 5 button presses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the fewest button presses required is 2. One way to do this is by pressing the last two buttons ((0,2) and (0,1)) once each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second machine can be configured with as few as 3 button presses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to achieve this is by pressing the last three buttons ((0,4), (0,1,2), and (1,2,3,4)) once each.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third machine has a total of six indicator lights that need to be configured correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fewest presses required to correctly configure it is 2; one way to do this is by pressing buttons (0,3,4) and (0,1,2,4,5) once each.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the indicator lights on all of the machines is 2 + 3 + 2 = 7.\n",
    "\n",

However, your finger is getting sore from all the button pushing, and so you will need to determine the fewest total presses required to correctly configure each machine's joltage level counters to match the specified joltage requirements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Configuring the second machine's counters requires a minimum of 12 button presses. One way to do this is by pressing (0,2,3,4) twice, (2,3) five times, and (0,1,2) five times.\n",
