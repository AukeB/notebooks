# Notebooks

This repository contains all kinds of different notebooks.

**Notebooks**:

- `advent_of_code_2025.py`: 🎄 Contains my solutions for all Advent of Code 2025 puzzles.

- `book_language_translation.ipynb`: 🌍 Processes an .epub file in another language (for example, German), detects all the different words in the vocabulary, categorize words linguistically, and translates each noun into another language (for example, Dutch).

- `image_to_text.ipynb`: 🖼️ Automates OCR extraction from image files, saves the recognized text to a .txt file, and optionally converts the results into a PDF document.

- `speech_to_text.ipynb`: 🎙️ Downloads audio from YouTube, transcribes it using OpenAI Whisper, merges the transcript with timestamps, and splits the result into manageable text chunks for further processing.
